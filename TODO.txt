Domains
-------
 -- Support for memory allocator to run Box [Vikram]

 -- We need "domain_create()" system call and how we pass system calls
    
     - Here it's a bit tricky, we need to pass unique system calls into each
       domain type. For example, device drvier domains get ukern syscalls, xv6
domains get both xv6 system calls and ukern syscalls (maybe it's not strictly
needed (we thought we need this for memory allocator to work, but maybe xv6 can
implement it's own allocator, but maybe it's not possible as it has to be
unsafe)

domain_create() 

  - Create a new thread for a domain, jump into entry point with a specific set
    of system calls

  - 

xv6
-----

 -- Move xv6 into ELF files [Tian?]

 -- Interrupt support for xv6, i.e. we need a layer that 
    starts interrupts as threads, the thread is parked waiting on an interrupt 
    and is woken up when the interrupt arrives

 - Scheduling support, i.e., all system calls to allow control over scheduling
   decisions


 -- xv6 user process creation 
    -- Need to figure out a prototype for "safe compilation" 

Device drviers
--------------

-- Move block device driver into loadable domains
